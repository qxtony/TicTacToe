TicTacToe — a simple game on a 3x3 field with an opponent.
=========================================================

This game was made by me, with some additional features.

What is interesting about this project?
---------------------------------------

· First, it's a playing field. It does not consist of simple characters such as vertical bar or dash, but of various unicode characters.
Thanks to this, it becomes more pleasant to play.

· The second thing in this project is the bot's algorithm, which helps him choose the best move to prevent his opponent from winning.

· And the last thing that can please the eye is a beautiful and colorful coloring.


You can see an example of the game in the video below:
